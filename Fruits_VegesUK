### Check duplicates
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as duplicate
FROM 
    `logical-light-389912.Fruits_Veges.data`
HAVING 
    duplicate < 1;

### No duplicates found


### Create table for updates - lets drop id column as it has not much valuable informations.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `logical-light-389912.Fruits_Veges.data_updates` 
  AS
    SELECT
      items,
      category,
      variety,
      date,
      unit,
      price,
    FROM
      `logical-light-389912.Fruits_Veges.data`;

### Data is not huge so lets have a look into columns for any wrong data(missing spellings, incorrect values)


### Check items column
SELECT 
    DISTINCT(items)

ORDER BY
    category;

### 56 Categories - Data has 3 categories Watercress, Watercress(d) and Watercress(f)


### Lets edit Watercress (d) and Watercress (f)
UPDATE
    `logical-light-389912.Fruits_Veges.data_updates`
SET
    category = "Watercress"
WHERE
    category = "Watercress (d)" OR category = "Watercress (f)";

###  modified 42 rows

### Check price column
SELECT
   DISTINCT(price)
FROM
    `logical-light-389912.Fruits_Veges.data_updates`
ORDER BY

### 946 records, There is some rows with "*" instead of price -(to remove)


### Check unit column
SELECT
   DISTINCT(unit)
FROM
    `logical-light-389912.Fruits_Veges.data_updates`
ORDER BY
    unit;

### 5 unique units -(kg, head, Steam, Unit, twin)
### There is Lettuce as head and twin but its okay as they are in same category


### Lets update null values from varieties to "All" to avoid reducing data
UPDATE
   `logical-light-389912.Fruits_Veges.data_updates`
SET
    variety = "All"
WHERE
   variety IS NULL OR
   variety = "All Varieties";

### 3,842 rows modified

    COUNT(variety) variety,
    COUNT(date) date,

### Lets also remove missing informations from price column
DELETE FROM
    `logical-light-389912.Fruits_Veges.data_updates`
WHERE
    price = "*";
### 2 rows removed
