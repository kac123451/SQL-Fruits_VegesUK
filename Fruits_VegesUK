### Check duplicates
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as duplicate
FROM 
    `logical-light-389912.Fruits_Veges.data`
HAVING 
    duplicate < 1;


### Create table for updates - lets leave id column as it has not much valuable informations.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `logical-light-389912.Fruits_Veges.data_updates` AS
    SELECT
        items,
        category,
        variety,

    `logical-light-389912.Fruits_Veges.data_updates`
SET 
    category = "Watercress"
WHERE 
    category = "Watercress (d)" OR category = "Watercress (f)";
###  modified 42 rows

###
Next step is save table "Fruits_Veges.data_updates" and import to tableau for Vizualizations(here)[https://public.tableau.com/trusted/ggvkfq65T9OkWhFQXAnWnQ==:9CSBhZ0qDmHBLDPpyJB5A8LL?:redirUrl=%2Fprofile%2Fapi%2Fpublish%2FinWORKFruitsandVegetablespricesUK2018-2023%2FStory1]
