### Data limitations:
This analysis is based on data from 2018 to 2023 year to date.
The incomplete data for 2023 could mean that the results for that year are slightly less accurate than the results for the other years.
However, the overall trend of the prices of fruits and vegetables is still likely to be accurate.

Additionally, the prices of fruits and vegetables can vary depending on a number of factors, such as the weather, the time of year, and the regions.
This means that the results of this analysis may not be generalizable to all fruits and vegetables or to all locations.

### Implications of Findings:
The findings of this study have several implications. 
 
* the rising cost of fruits and vegetables could make it more difficult for people to afford a healthy diet. This is a particular concern for low-income households,
* could have a negative impact on the environment. This is because fruits and vegetables are often grown using intensive agricultural practices that can damage the soil and water. 
* and could lead to changes in the way people eat. For example, people may be more likely to choose processed foods instead of fresh fruits and vegetables.

### Recommendations

The findings of this study suggest that there is a need for policies to address the rising cost of fruits and vegetables. These policies could include:

Subsidizing the production and sale of fruits and vegetables.
Making fruits and vegetables more accessible to low-income households.
Educating people about the importance of eating a healthy diet.
